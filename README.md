# ✈️ Air Traffic Insights

## 📘 Overview
This project performs an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on airline flight data to uncover key insights about flight delays, airline performance, and travel patterns.  
It leverages Python-based data analysis and visualization tools to help understand trends, correlations, and operational metrics across airlines and routes.

---

## 🧠 Objectives
- Analyze flight delays and cancellations.
- Identify top-performing airlines and routes.
- Visualize patterns in departure and arrival times.
- Derive insights from seasonal and temporal trends.

## 📈 Key Insights (Example)

Most flight delays occur during evening hours.

Weather and traffic at major airports significantly impact delays.

Certain airlines maintain consistent on-time performance across routes.

Average delay time shows strong correlation with flight distance.

## 🖼️ Visualizations

Includes graphical insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn:

Distribution of flight delays

Airline-wise comparison of delays

Monthly/seasonal trends

Correlation heatmaps

## 🚀 Future Work

Predict flight delays using machine learning models.

Integrate live flight data via APIs.

Build a Power BI dashboard for interactive analysis.
